	<h3>About</br></h3>
	<p>The Haji Ali Dargah is an iconic mosque in Mumbai, Maharashtra. It is located 500 yards into the Arabian Sea. It is the tomb of Saint Haji Ali. A constricted path leads to the dargah. The white mosque can be accessed only during the low tide.

There are two popular legends surrounding the Haji Ali Dargah. According to the first, Haji Ali was a rich businessman who renounced the worldly pleasures after his visit to Mecca and was then engrossed in meditation. The other legend suggests that Haji Ali went on a pilgrimage to Mecca and died there but his casket miraculously drifted back to the shores of Mumbai.

In accordance with the Muslim tradition, Haji Ali Dargah has different praying rooms for ladies and gents. Since one cannot visit the mausoleum during the low tide, there's an offshore location situated on the opposite side of Mahalakshmi racecourse.

After passing through the carved entrance of Haji Ali Dargah, you enter the marble courtyard containing the main shrine. Hundreds of devotees come to the mosque to seek blessings of the saint. The tomb is covered with red and green coloured chaddar enclosed in a wonderful silver frame. The tomb is ornamented with beautiful mirror work of different colours and the ninety-nine names of Allah are inscribed on it in Arabic. The huge courtyard has a number of refreshment stalls. The dargah has now thrown open the doors to its inner shrine for women as well.
