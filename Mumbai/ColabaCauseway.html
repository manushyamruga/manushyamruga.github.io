	<p>Forming the southern tip of Mumbai, Colaba is a historical island and a great tourism attraction. It is very near to the Gateway of India, the most visited spot of the city. Colaba was a part of the cluster of Islands that the Portuguese gifted to Charles II in his marriage. Colaba came under the British East India Company in 1668 and became an army cantonment. Later with the opening of the Cotton exchange, the area turned into a trade center.

Colaba is famous for its shopping value. It can be said that it is a one stop shop, where one can get anything he wants.
