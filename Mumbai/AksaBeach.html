	<h3>About</br></h3>
	<p>It is located in the north suburbs of Mumbai in the Aksa village and is nearly 12 kilometers from Borivali and 9 kilometers from Malad stations. It can be reached by buses, autos or taxis from Malad and Borivali stations.

The beach is clean and has a serene environment. Swimming is unsafe due to strong currents and shifting of the sand beneath. The cool breeze and the sunset in the evening mesmerises everyone who visit it. Along with the sunset view, one can enjoy long walks along the lush foliage on one side and the sea on the other. It is not so frequented by tourists but popular with young lovers due to its clean and tranquil environment. It is very well known as a lovers' beach. No other beach offers so much of seclusion and absence of annoying peddlers as Aksa beach in Mumbai. One could find a large variety of shells and snails on the beach earlier as it used to be deserted and quiet, but the influx of visitors who want to escape the busy schedule of the city, has made it a coveted destination for them.

It has many cottages and hotels meant for renting out to the tourists and visitors. There are few snack stalls where one can quench one's thirst and hunger.
