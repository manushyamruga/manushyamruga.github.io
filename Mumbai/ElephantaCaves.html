	<h3>About</br></h3>
	<p>Elephanta caves are a UNESCO World Heritage site with beautiful carvings and sculptures. In the vicinity of the financial capital of India, Mumbai, these caves offer you the much-needed peace from the chaos of the metropolitan. It is a good place to look into the past culture and art. Here you will find two categories of caves; one is the Hindu rock art and the other is the Buddhist rock art. The place is still worshipped by the locals, and is dedicated to Lord Shiva. One can spot some resemblance to the Ajanta and Ellora caves, which are around 300 km from Elephanta.</p>
	
	<h3>History and Architecture</br></h3>
	<p>Not much is known about the origin of the Elephanta Caves. The island was previously known as Gharapuri and renamed as Elephanta by Portuguese. These are believed to have built in the 7th century. It is still unclear as to which dynasty ruled when the caves were being built. However, historians are of the opinion that prince of the Chalukya Dynasty, Pulkesin II, built the Shiva shrine to celebrate his victory. The hugeness of the project and the great craftsmanship has led historians to come to a conclusion that only a powerful kingdom could have built such a large and magnificent architectural marvel as it needed great artisans to carve such sculptures out of solid rock.</P>
	<p>The whole complex is built on an area of 60,000 sq feet and comprises seven caves that date back to AD 600. Cave 1 impresses the most. It is popular due to the exquisite and perfect sculptures. The caves are devoted to Hindu deities and you can see Buddhist caves as well. Elephant caves showcase the Indian art with its impeccable expressions and the huge reliefs in the caves.</P>
