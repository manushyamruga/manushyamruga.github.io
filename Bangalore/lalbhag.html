	<h3>About</br></h3>
		
		<p>If you are in Bengaluru, the capital city of the southern state of Karnataka, and ask the locals for the best place to visit, it is very likely that most people will mention the Lalbagh Botanical Garden. This sprawling flower garden is not only one of the best features of the city, but is also the pride of the people of Bengaluru. Administered and maintained under the Government of Karnataka’s Directorate of Horticulture, the garden is home to a great variety of flowering and medicinal plants and trees from around the world. Many of these are rare varieties, conserved here.

	<h3>History and Architecture</br></h3>
	<p>The history of this iconic garden of southern India is a long one. The Lalbagh Garden was initially commissioned by Hyder Ali, the Sultan of Mysore, in 1760 – about a year before he made himself ruler of the kindgom by overthrowing the then Maharaja. Soon after Hyder Ali’s death in 1782, his son Tipu Sultan took over as the Sultan of Mysore. He continued with the construction of Lalbagh and imported rare flowering plants from many parts of the world including Persia, Turkey, Mauritius, Afghanistan, and even South Africa. Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan’s love of Nature is evident from the number of flower gardens they have commissioned across the erstwhile state of Mysore. In its early days, it is believed, that the highlight of the Lalbagh was a variety of red roses that flowered all through the year. It is perhaps after these red blossoms that the garden was named Lalbagh.
	The Lalbagh Botanical Garden is a veritable treasure house of rare and medicinal plants and trees, apart from flowering plants. It is home to over 1850 species and 670 genera of plants. Plants from various parts of the world can be found here.
	The Directorate of Horticulture, Karnataka Government, conducts regular workshops and training courses for the public and fledgling botanists. Courses include ornamental gardening, bonsai gardening, horticulture, fruit and vegetable preservation and processing.
