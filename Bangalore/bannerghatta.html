	<h3>History and Architecture</br></h3>
	<p>
		
	Bannerghatta is the first biological park in India to have a fenced forested elephant sanctuary where elephants can roam around freely without chains. A newly captured elephant was bought here. It was a herculean task to get such a huge animal to the national park. During offloading, it got stuck in the truck, cranes were called to ensure safety of this animal. Presence of elephant expert Carol Buckley made sure that chirag suffered no further troubles. His eating habits were also taken care of, which primarily includes grass. It is designed by elephant expert Carol Buckley and covers an area of 122 acres.[15] The fence is sponsored by animal rights organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) India, which raised funds of Rs. 1 crore for its installation. “The elephants are absolutely free to roam without human interference, and will be free of tussles with other wild elephants,” Manilal Valliyate, PETA India's Director of Veterinary Affairs was quoted saying in an interview to The Hindu.[16] According to a report published in Times of India, US elephant expert Margaret Whittaker came up with the innovative idea after visiting BBP last year. She gave the local mahouts training on 'protected contact' with the jumbos. This leads to safe interaction between human beings and elephants by keeping them separated while at the same time using positive techniques to manage the animals.
